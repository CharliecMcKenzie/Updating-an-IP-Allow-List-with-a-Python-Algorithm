 <h1>Updating an IP Allow List with a Python Algorithm</h1>
 
 <h2>Project Overview</h2>
 At my organization, access to restricted content is controlled through an IP allow list specified in the "allow_list.txt" file. We also maintain a remove list to identify IP addresses that should no longer have access. To automate the update process, I developed a Python algorithm to modify the "allow_list.txt" file by removing IP addresses listed in the remove list.
